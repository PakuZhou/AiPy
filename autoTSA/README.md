# Auto Time Series Analysis
This is some work of the course:Applied Time Series Analysis.

In my codesï¼ŒI tried to make the program find the model automatically,
the project contains :
- reTSA.py:use the ARIMA model to fit the data,if can't,call findSARIMA.py.
- findSARIMA.py:use the grid-search tech to find the best model according to AIC .

Due to time constraints, the code is a bit messy and can not be run directly.
